🚀 Day 2 – #30DaysOfPythonChallenge ✅
Hosted by: Indian Data Club
Topic: Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans, and Type Conversion
Challenge: Calculate the Area of a Rectangle using user input.

🧠 Concepts Covered
Working with basic data types:

int, float, str, bool

Type conversion using int(), float(), str()

Getting input from the user using input()

Simple arithmetic operations

Printing results with print()

🔍 Problem Statement
Create a Python program that:

Prompts the user to enter the length of a rectangle.

Prompts the user to enter the width of a rectangle.

Calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula:

Area
=
Length
×
Width
Area=Length×Width
Prints the area in a user-friendly message.

# Day 2 - Calculate Area of a Rectangle

# Get user input
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate area
area = length * width

# Display the result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
✅ Sample Output
yaml

Edit
Enter the length of the rectangle: 5.5
Enter the width of the rectangle: 3.2
The area of the rectangle is: 17.6
